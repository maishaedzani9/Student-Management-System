University Management System

This project is a simple University Management System that demonstrates basic object-oriented programming concepts, such as inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism, using Java. It models different types of people at a university, including Students,Faculty, and Staff, and allows you to create instances of each and display their details.

 Features:
- Student Class: Represents a student with details like ID, name, email, major, and GPA.
- Person Class: The base class for all people in the system, containing common attributes like ID, name, and email.
- Employee Class: An abstract class that extends `Person`, with common fields for employees like office location, and a method to return employee type.
- Faculty Class: A subclass of `Employee`, representing faculty members with additional details like rank.
- Staff Class: A subclass of `Employee`, representing staff members with additional details like title.
- UniversitySystemDemo: A simple demo that creates a student, faculty, and staff instance, and prints their details.
